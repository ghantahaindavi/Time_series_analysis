# Time_series_analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing CO2 emissions data across various countries and sectors to understand global emission trends. Using a dataset that tracks daily CO2 emissions from sectors like Power, Industry, and Transport, the project explores which countries and industries contribute the most to global emissions. Through statistical analysis and interactive visualizations, it highlights key insights, such as the dominance of China and the Power sector in emissions, and identifies outliers in the data. The findings aim to support environmental research, policy-making, and public awareness efforts to combat climate change.

Key Components of the Project:
Data Loading and Initial Exploration:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (dataset.csv) and contains columns such as country, date, sector, value (CO2 emissions in MtCO2/day), and timestamp.

The dataset is explored to understand its structure, including the number of rows, columns, and basic statistics.

Data Aggregation and Summary:

The data is grouped by country and sector to calculate summary statistics such as mean, sum, and count of CO2 emissions.

The project identifies the total CO2 emissions for each country and sector, providing insights into which countries and sectors contribute the most to global CO2 emissions.

Statistical Analysis:

A t-test is performed to compare the CO2 emissions between two countries (Russia and China) to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in their emissions.

Z-scores are calculated to identify outliers in the dataset, which are data points that deviate significantly from the mean.

Data Visualization:

Bar Charts: Bar charts are used to visualize the total CO2 emissions by country and by sector. The charts highlight which countries and sectors are the largest contributors to CO2 emissions.

Choropleth Map: A choropleth map is created to visualize CO2 emissions by country, excluding global aggregates like "WORLD" and "ROW". This map provides a geographical representation of emissions.

Box Plots: Box plots are used to show the distribution of CO2 emissions across different sectors, helping to identify variations and outliers within each sector.

Insights and Findings:

The project reveals that China and the Power sector are the largest contributors to global CO2 emissions.

The WORLD aggregate shows significantly higher emissions compared to individual countries, indicating the cumulative impact of global emissions.

The Power sector has the highest emissions, followed by Industry and Ground Transport.

Key Findings:
Top Emitting Countries: China, the US, and India are among the top contributors to global CO2 emissions.

Top Emitting Sectors: The Power sector is the largest contributor, followed by Industry and Ground Transport.

Outliers: The analysis identifies outliers in the data, particularly in the Power sector, where some days show unusually high emissions.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Scipy: For statistical tests (t-test) and z-score calculations.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For basic plotting.

Plotly: For interactive and advanced visualizations (bar charts, choropleth maps, box plots).

Potential Applications:
Policy Making: The insights from this analysis can help policymakers identify which countries and sectors need targeted interventions to reduce CO2 emissions.

Environmental Research: Researchers can use this data to study trends in CO2 emissions and their impact on climate change.

Public Awareness: Visualizations can be used to raise public awareness about the major contributors to CO2 emissions and the need for sustainable practices.

Next Steps:
Predictive Modeling: The dataset could be used to build predictive models to forecast future CO2 emissions based on historical trends.

Time Series Analysis: Further analysis could focus on how CO2 emissions have changed over time, identifying seasonal patterns or long-term trends.

Sector-Specific Analysis: Deeper dives into specific sectors (e.g., Power, Industry) could reveal more detailed insights into emission sources and potential reduction strategies.
